That might be starting a tech company, learning a new skill, running a non profit, or helping friends and loved ones.  It has resulted in a life that is full of wonderful challenges and people, where I can't ever imagine retiring.   When I was young, my mother isolated me from family in an unsafe environment. This caused me to become very self reliant.  But I really like connecting with people and subscribe to the idea that life is a team sport.  We do everything better when we find people to do them with, a community that helps each other when we need to, encourages us to learn from our collective mistakes, and celebrates our wins as if they were their own."
